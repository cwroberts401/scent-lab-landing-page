		<p>To our community -</p>
		<p>This year has been an big one - we launched perfume, won some of the most-coveted beauty awards, revealed Scent Lab 2.0 and most importantly, we grew our community.</p>		
		<p>Some of you have been on this journey with me since we first launched in 2022 or even earlier when we were testing things out and I was hand-pouring candles from my small NYC apartment (!!!) I truly mean it when I say that we couldn’t have gotten to where we are today as a brand & community if I didn’t have your support along the way. You helped make us better on every turn.</p>	
		<p>As a small business, navigating through this tough market has been hard and has come with a fair share of ups & downs. As we were coming on a close of this year, I had to make some really hard decisions including what the future of Scent Lab looks like.</p>	
		<p>We have made the decision to close shop as of January 1st 2025. We will not be accepting any more orders. If you currently have an order in process, do not worry - it’s coming your way and will be there soon :)</p>
		<p>I hope you know how much this experience and each one of you have meant to me over the years. Thank you for helping make my dream come true in bringing the lab to life. If you have any questions, I will be monitoring info@shopscentlab.com so shoot me a note and I will get back to you ASAP.</p>
